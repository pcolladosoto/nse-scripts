# A bunch of NSE scripts
This repository contains NSE scripts we have written in an effort to get acquainted with the Lua
programming language as well as with the NSE itself. They usually do quite silly things, but
they might even prove useful from a networking-centered perspective to some.

At the very least they can serve as a smooth introduction into writing scripts for the NSE: the
scripts are heavily commented and contain myriads of links to documentation.

We hope they are worth your time!
